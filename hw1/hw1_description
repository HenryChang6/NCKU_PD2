Homework Description:
Given an Integer value N as the input (from command line arguments),
please list all combinations “line by line” to the console in the form of
“(X,Y)”, where X+Y=N, X>=0 and Y>=0. The output should be sorted by X
in ascending order. Please also show the maximum value of X*Y in the
last line.

Note:
1. N>0 and N<1000.
2. Remember to order the output by X line by line. We will examine your
correctness by our shell script without any excuse.
3. Please list the result to console. We will use the shell operator “>” to
an output file named “result”.
4. You need to declare the executable file named “hw1” which will be
generated by using your makefile with “make all”.
5. We will only give a single integer as the input. You don't need to take
care of any datatype exception.
6. For the convenience of checking your homework, Output must not
contain any blank characters or other characters, otherwise your
score will be deducted.
