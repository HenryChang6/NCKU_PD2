Homework Description:
Given a simple csv file (file name will be given by the input argument) in
which each line contains the employee information “employee_id”,
“age”, “gender”, and “salary”. Could you use concept of CLASSES to
answer:
In each line, list all employee_ids which corresponding salaries are the
same, and each employee_id is separated by “,”. The first value in each
line is the salary. Lines are printed out according to the corresponding
salary line by line in the ascending order.
The order of employee_ids in each line should be sorted by the
corresponding age in the ascending order. If more than two equal-salary
employees have the same age, the order should ‘lady first’.
Please use ‘cout’ to send all result to console.

Note:
1. It is encouraged that you can “use chatGPT”.
2. The maximum number of employees is smaller than 10,000, meaning
that the number of input line is smaller than 10,000.
3. Remember the strict ordering policy. We will examine your
correctness by our shell script without any excuse.
4. Please list the result to console. We will use the shell operator “>” to
copy all your homework output to a created file named “result”.
5. You need to declare the executable file named “hw2” which will be
generated by using your makefile with “make all”.
6. The csv file name will be given as the input argument without any
exception of file handle error.
7. For the convenience of checking your homework, output must not
contain any blank characters or other characters, otherwise your
score will be deducted.
8. It is okay if you know how to use the STL library.
9. We only count the result correction. The execution efficiency is
relatively minor in this homework (unless the execution hangs more
than 10 minutes).
